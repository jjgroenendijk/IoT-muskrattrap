# Project Overview
This project focuses on muskrat management in the Netherlands, where water boards are responsible for controlling these
animals to prevent flooding.
This control is regulated by law and carried out by muskrat managers.
However, there is an ongoing debate about animal welfare and biodiversity in relation to muskrats.

In this context, a student from the Embedded Systems Engineering (ESE) program is developing a new product called
"SMARTrap."
SMARTrap is a muskrat trap with IoT functionality.
The project focuses on developing an IoT node integrated into the trap.
This node sends sensor data to a server application, allowing managers to monitor the status of the trap and the capture
of muskrats via a website.
The trap should be able to report whether it is open or closed, detect if a muskrat is present, indicate if the trap has
been moved, and provide its health data.
A magnet sensor is used to detect if the trap is closed, and an infrared sensor is used to detect life within the trap.
The goal is to create a cost-effective, user-friendly, and sustainable IoT solution that makes non-lethal muskrat traps "smart".
